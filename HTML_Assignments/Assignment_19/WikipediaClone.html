                stood at a staggering ₹50.78 trillion (US$600 billion). This is a significant milestone, marking over a

                    <h4>2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco</h4>
                    <p>
                        In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of
                        close to $4 billion, citing a lack of liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic. These funds had
                        large exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities. The Securities and Exchange
                        Board of India (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses and
                        violations”. As a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from
                        launching any new debt schemes for two years. The regulator also ordered the fund house to
                        refund investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees, and
                        fined the global giant another 50 million rupees.<sup style="color: blue;">[15][16][17][18]</sup>

                        Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order and planned to appeal
                        against it. The decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving
                        value for unitholders”, a spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic
                        withdrawals from other Franklin Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset
                        managers, leading to a storm on social media and court cases by distraught
                        investors.<sup style="color: blue;">[18][15][17]</sup>

                        In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure
                        to troubled companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe
                        redemptions and forced asset sales, which significantly affected investors.<sup style="color: blue;">[19][20]</sup>

                    <h4>IL&FS crisis and impact</h4>
                    <p>
                        The IL&FS crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those
                        managed by IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on
                        its debt obligations and inter-corporate deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress
                        in the financial markets and led to significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the
                        affected mutual fund schemes, resulting in losses to investors.<sup style="color: blue;">[21][22][23]</sup></p>
                    <p>
                        The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity
                        crisis, making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets
                        at distressed prices. This event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread
                        downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net
                        asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities were adversely affected, reflecting
                        the increased credit risk and decreased market confidence.<sup style="color: blue;">[24][25][26][27]</sup></p>
                    <p>
                        Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and
                        infrastructure debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors
                        moved towards safer and more liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange
                        Board of India (SEBI) introduced stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer
                        limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in debt funds to enhance liquidity and reduce
                        risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and improved risk management
                        practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and liquidity
                        management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the
                        mutual fund industry.<sup style="color: blue;">[24][25][26][27]</sup>

                        The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual
                        fund industry. DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual
                        funds to meet redemption pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This
                        crisis raised significant concerns about the creditworthiness of housing finance companies
                        (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt
                        instruments and adversely affecting the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these
                        securities.<sup style="color: blue;">[32][33][34][35]</sup></p>

                        Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs,
                        was severely shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In
                        response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced
                        tighter regulations on mutual funds' exposure to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such
                        risks in the future. Fund managers adjusted their portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality
                        and more liquid assets, reducing exposure to high-risk debt instruments. The crisis underscored
                        the importance of credit quality and liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a

                    <p>
                        The Unit Trust of India (UTI) faced a significant crisis in 2001, which was primarily due to
                        large-scale redemption pressures and mismanagement, particularly in its flagship scheme,
                        US-6412. The crisis was exacerbated by the Ketan Parekh scam, which caused a sharp decline in
                        stock prices, leading to mutual funds, including UTI’s schemes, suffering severe
                        consequences.<sup style="color: blue;">[36][37][38]</sup></p>
                    <p>
                        The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to
                        the bifurcation of UTI into two separate entities in 2003: the UTI Mutual Fund (now managed by

                    <p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This
                        event led to significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment
                        obligations, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1.
                        The default affected several mutual funds, including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset
                        Management India Private Limited, which had to mark down the value of their investments in
                        DHFL’s securities.<sup style="color: blue;">[39][40][32][35]</sup></p>
                    <p>
                        The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a
                        cumulative exposure of ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a
                        severe liquidity issue and a drop in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting
                        investors’ returns. DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund, which was a joint venture between DHFL and
                        Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced challenges due to the exposure to DHFL’s debt
                        instruments.<sup style="color: blue;">[39][40][32][35]</sup></p>

                    <p>In 2019, Yes Bank faced severe financial stress and was eventually placed under a moratorium by
                        the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in March 2020. This led to significant challenges for Yes Mutual
                        Fund, particularly its debt schemes that had exposure to Yes Bank’s securities. The crisis
                        necessitated write-downs and affected investor confidence. Around 32 mutual fund schemes had
                        exposure to Yes Bank’s downgraded debt papers, with a total exposure amounting to approximately
                        ₹2,848 crore. The crisis led to write-downs of these securities and impacted the net asset
                        values (NAVs) of the mutual funds involved, which in turn affected investor

                    <p>In 2019, Kotak Mutual Fund did face challenges with its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to
                        exposure to debt securities of companies like the Essel Group. The fund house was unable to
                        redeem investments from these companies, which led to delays and partial rollovers of the FMPs.
                        This situation affected the investors’ expected returns. Consequently, the Securities and
                        Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Kotak from launching new FMPs for six months and imposed a

                        about Rs 1 lakh crore. Similarly, Essel Group companies were grappling with debt woes, which put
                        mutual funds, including HDFC, under redemption pressure. However, HDFC Mutual Fund later
                        recovered the entire investment made in the non-convertible debentures issued by Essel Group

                        of a previous SEBI order from 2011 concerning two other Sahara entities, which were directed to
                        refund money collected through Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) to
